This is a Blazor Game developed using Blazor WebAssembly (Standalone App).
Itâ€™s built with the .NET 9 framework and uses the Minimax algorithm for the AI player.

The idea for this project came from a learning path on Microsoft Learn, where a two-player game was used to teach Blazor components. That inspired me to make something more exciting â€” by turning the second player into an AI opponent.

ðŸ§  The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm, allowing it to make strategic moves just like a real player.

Note
There is file .nojekyll is needed just for github, it helps no to ignore subfolders when running the project.
This branch contains only the published build of the project.
The full source code will be made publicly available soon.
